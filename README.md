A complete course on object detection and recognition. Works on the following datasets: 
Caltech 5, LabelMe and PASCAL.

This is code for object detection on images. The method is described in

  TITLE = {{Segmentation Driven Object Detection with Fisher Vectors}}, 
  BOOKTITLE = {{ICCV 2013 - IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision}}, 
 }
 
The code is written in Matlab, with critical routines in C/C++,
interfaced with mex. It does not depend on a particular Matlab
toolbox. It is applied by default on the Pascal VOC detection challenge, see
